# Associating a Visitor with a Recognized Customer - Registering a New Customer

## Step 1
In the same Google Tag Manager account: 
* Create a new trigger and name it, _register_user_trigger_.
* Set the Trigger Type to Form Submission.
* Check the "Wait for Tags" checkbox and set the "Max wait time" to 6000 milliseconds.
* Under "Enable this trigger when all of these conditions are true", select "Page URL", "equals" and enter the URL of your website's form used by a customer to register.
* Set the trigger to fire on "Some Forms".
* Under "Fire this trigger when an Event occurs and all of these conditions are true", select "Page URL", "equals" and enter the same register form URL you entered above.

>**Note:**
If you have two forms on the same page, you can create a trigger that fires based on the form ID, instead of the page URL. To find the form ID, open the page in your browser, and right-click on the form, and select Inspect. There, within the HTML for the form, you'll find the id parameter value in the form tag.

## Step 2
In the tag section of Google Tag Manager: 
* Create a new tag and name it, _register_user_tag_.
* Set the type to Custom HTML. 
* Set the firing trigger to _register_user_trigger_.

## Step 3
* Go to the Custom HTML field for _register_user_tag_.

* Paste in this code:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">

// Register user variables
var SDK_ID = email = document.getElementById("Email").value;

// Passing the variables to the SDK function
// Set the 'optin' param to the value of your 'optin' checkbox if one    exists
optimoveSDK.API.registerUser(SDK_ID, email, "signup", {source:"create account", optin: true})

</script>
```

>**Note:**
In the above code snippet, SDK_ID is set to the email address entered by the customer in the form. If you're using a different SDK_ID, you will need to change the code so that SDK_ID is set to the correct value.

## Step 4
* Save the _register_user_tag_ that you just created.
* Click Preview to check the changes on your site (in Preview mode).
