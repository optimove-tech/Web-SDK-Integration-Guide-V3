# Verifying the SDK Implementation
This document provides instructions on how to test and confirm your  [SDK implementation](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Web-SDK-Integration-Guide-V3). Please make sure all the steps below have been followed.

If a test fails to show the expected results, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

>Please make sure to use incognito mode and clear cache and website data before getting started.

## Step One: Verify SDK Initialization

**SDK files**
<br>
To perform the test, visit or reload a page on your website where the SDK has been implemented on.

Then, go to Dev tools > Network > filter to SDK.

***Expected test results:***
<br>
The SDK file "?tenant_id=XXX" appears, where ‘XXX’ is the tenant id provided to you by Optimove.

**Optimove SDK metadata**
<br>
To perform the test, enter your website.
Then, go to Dev tools > Network > filter to stream

***Expected test results:***
<br>
optimove_sdk_metadata event fired when entering the website
This is a default event generated by the SDK to capture UTM params and will fire when first landing on your website.

## Step Two: Verify Core Events
**"pageVisit" event - visitors**
<br>
To perform the test, navigate between different pages on your website.

Then, go to Dev tools > Network > filter to Optimove

***Expected test results:***
<br>
1. pageVisit event is reported to realtime on every page
2. pageVisit event is reported to stream on every page
3. URL and Title parameters are populated
4. URL is valid
5. Visitor ID is populated and consistent until setUserId is called

If the website is a Single Page Application (SPA) or semi Single Page Application, make sure pageVisit is reported when the page isn't reloaded as well. This can be implemented using the History Change trigger in GTM.

<br>

**registration event**
<br>
To perform the test, register to your website.
Then, go to Dev tools > Network > filter to Optimove.

***Expected test results:***

1. set_user_id_event is reported to stream after registration
2. set_user_id_event is reported to realtime after registration
3. registration event is reported to stream after registration
4. registration event is  reported to realtime after registration
5. CID: "SDK_ID" (the customer id sent to Optimove in the daily)
6.  Parameters configured as part of events are correctly populated

>Make sure to test all registration points on your website.

**"pageVisit" event - existing customers**
<br>
To perform the test, navigate between different pages.
Then, go to Dev tools > Network > filter to Optimov

***Expected test results:***
<br>
1. pageVisit event is reported to realtime on every page
2. pageVisit event is reported to stream on every page
3. CID: "SDK_ID" is populated 
4. Visitor ID will change to updated visitor ID

<br>

**login event**
<br>
To perform the test, login to your website.
Then, go to Dev tools > Network > filter to Optimove.



***Expected test results:***
<br>

1. login is reported to realtime after login
2. login is reported to stream after login
3. CID: "SDK_ID" (the customer id sent to Optimove in the daily)
4. Visitor ID will change to updated visitor ID

Note: 
> **Set_user_id_event**
>This event will be shown in the Dev tool whenever event has been sent including a customer ID and the customer ID is not saved in the cache
